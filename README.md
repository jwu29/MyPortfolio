Hi, welcome to Josiah Wu's portfolio! Please read below for my personal projects. 

# Data Science

## [Investigation of Entry-Exit figures and travel time in London Underground](https://github.com/jwu29/TubeVisual)

* Fetched station data from the TfL REST API using Python.
* Implemented ETL process to visualize average travel time using Python, SQL and Google Cloud Functions.
* Visualised entry-exit figures with 2014-17 London Underground Data on an automated Tableau dashboard connected with Google BigQuery.

## [Recreating the 2021/22 Premier League Season with Poisson Processes](https://github.com/jwu29/21-22PLSimulation)

* Extracted ~800 rows of goal-scoring data from the Premier League website using Selenium and beautifulsoup4 in Python.
* Modelled goal-scoring for each team through inhomogeneous Poisson Processes in R, using optim and fitdistrplus.
* Simulated full-time scores for all matches and the final league table.
* Created a poster presenting my results.

## [AI Hack 2022 - Forecasting change in electricity costs](https://github.com/jwu29/AIHack2022-Group1)

* A team project in AI Hack 2022, an annual hackathon hosted by Imperial College Data Science Society.
* Constructed an ARIMA model to forecast change in electricity costs using time series data in Python.
* Applied Dickey-Fuller test to test for seasonality and stationarity in electricity costs.

## [Predicting Genre of Music with Neural Networks](https://github.com/jwu29/music-genre-predictor)

* Constructed a multi-layer perceptron and utilized Kaggle data sets to train the neural network using tensorflow and keras in Python.
* Trained the neural network with training data; cross-validation with test data.
* Classification Report - including confusion matrix and metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, support.
* Composed a written report of my results and conclusions. Awarded runners-up in the competition.

## [Statistical trends in the general playing style of Major League Baseball](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1togUvvKaK-zmpXBeoSVa4yxoX7fL2fUNDo8rWkH2E2c/edit?usp=sharing)

* Fetched data from baseballsavant.com
* Investigated the increase in pitchers’ fastball velocity and spin rate using Student’s t-test & F-test from Analysis of Variance in Excel & R.
* Visualized the effect of spin rate and Magnus force on the trajectory of a pitch using MATLAB.
* Presented my findings in front of a general audience who have little knowledge about baseball.


# UI/UX & Game Design

## [ImpVis Project – Creating interactive online visualizations on abstract STEM concepts](https://jwu29.github.io/ImpVisGroup1project-main/Group1main1-2.html)

*	A group project in ImpVis Project, a course aimed to create interactive online visualizations on abstract STEM concepts.
*	Created a game to educate fourth-year medical students about the procedure and applications of q-PCR using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.
*	Designed a website which included the game and other helpful resources (e.g. YouTube videos)
