Hi, welcome to Josiah Wu's portfolio! Please read below for my personal projects. 

# Data Science

## [Investigation of Entry-Exit figures and travel time in London Underground](https://github.com/jwu29/TubeVisual)

* Fetched station data from the TfL REST API using Python.
* Implemented ETL process to visualize average travel time using Python, SQL and Google Cloud Functions.
* Visualised entry-exit figures with 2014-17 London Underground Data on an automated Tableau dashboard connected with Google BigQuery.

## [Recreating the 2021/22 Premier League Season with Poisson Processes](https://github.com/jwu29/21-22PLSimulation)

* Extracted ~800 rows of goal-scoring data from the Premier League website using Selenium and beautifulsoup4 in Python.
* Modelled goal-scoring for each team through inhomogeneous Poisson Processes in R, using optim and fitdistrplus.
* Simulated full-time scores for all matches and the final league table.
* Created a poster presenting my results.
